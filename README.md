# MacOS Timer app

A simple timer menu bar app for MacOS, written in Swift.

Allows the user to create multiple independent timers via the menu bar. A notification is triggered when each timer ends.

## Motivation

The apps I found on the App Store were either more complicated that I needed, didn't allow multiple timers, or had a terrible UI. So I decided to write my own.

## Status

Currently WIP - features are largely finished, but needs some polishing.

Next step is to publish it on the App Store.
